# LGM Website

This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for the LGM website.

## Structure

- **Frontend**: Next.js application
- **Backend**: Node.js API with Prisma

## Setup

### Frontend
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note: The backend server is located in `src/server.js` and will start automatically with the `npm run dev` command. Do not try to run `node server.js` directly from the backend root directory.
